        I'm a software developer with hands-on experience building real-world
        apps using React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. I care
        about clean code, meaningful features, and writing my own tests with
        Jest and SuperTest to keep things reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've completed an intensive bootcamp and will soon begin a Computer
        Science degree to deepen my foundation â€” but I'm ready to contribute
        now. I'm looking for a junior developer role where I can keep learning,
        solve useful problems, and grow with a thoughtful team. After university
        starts, I plan to continue part-time, ideally on weekends.
